# anche a te e famiglia bot
For pissed of people

## Telegram Public Bot
[Use it on Telegram!](https://t.me/aatf_bot)

## How to use it
Just start the bot and type in other chats ```@aatf_bot``` and wait for the hints

## settings.json
I placed a file called settings_sample.json since I can't commit the original file because it contains the bot key obtained from BotFather.

## phrase.py
phrase.py just reads replies_list.json and pass the staff via the getName(i) function, pretty simple stuff.
